## What I learned?
During this project I learned the importance of understanding how importnat proper syntax was, very common mistake for myself was not noticing a small error.
Learning to incorporate Ajax and JSON to pull information from the API was a challenge, but feels great to have some understanding of how information can be sent from other sites.
Gulp and Browsersync make life easier after getting them set up, it's nice to see your changees have an effect right away.
